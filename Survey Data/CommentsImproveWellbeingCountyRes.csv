Once in recovery there are no adequate transportation, decent paying jobs, and hence no affordable housing. This only serves to perpetuate and intensify life stressors, which in turn, leads to relapse. Community partners (CBHC, Riverside, etc) are unable to properly support individuals with these very expensive and high risk need without community supports in place...creating revolving door scenario, and financial strain on economy (law enforcement, judicial, housing, etc)."

Lack of understanding here that the working class cannot afford to pay the high rents/high health care with the wages we make. Low income housing is great, but when you are above it you are at the mercy of the greedy landlords. How will this generation ever be able to save money for a house or retirement? Very entitled county of snowbirds! Start taking care of the year round residents who live, work and shop here."

The plan I've heard is more geared toward children, but they still have to coexist with adults who are seriously struggling with mental health issues attributed to ACE and they have no idea that anything is even wrong with them, let alone that help may be available. Most have been told they're no good or lazy their entire life. So they turn to drugs/crime etc to cope or they just kind of skate along trying to get by. It's tragic and sad. I don't know what the answer is, but would be willing to get involved to help educate the poor souls who really need it. ACE have life long consequences. Missing brain connections are no joke, and most if not all of these victims have not idea what's even wrong with them or that a diagnosis exists."
